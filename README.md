GraphicExpenditure
==================
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This project is meant to help people effectively understand their expense status so that can smartly manage and plan the 
future spending. GraphicExpenditure is a pure web application which takes use of Dropbox as a static web server. This means
that there is no "server side" code. All the code is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The premise of using 
this application is to be a Dropbox user. With a Dropbox account in hand, you will have private storage "in the cloud" to
store your personal data. GraphicExpenditure provides methods to input the data and present those data.
