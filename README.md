GraphicExpenditure
==================
This project is meant to help people effectively understand their expense status so that can smartly manage and plan the 
future spending. GraphicExpenditure is a pure web application which takes use of Dropbox as a static web server. This means
that there is no "server side" code and all the code is composed by HTML, CSS, as well as JavaScript. The premise of using 
this application is to be a Dropbox user. With a Dropbox account in hand, you will have private storage "in the cloud" to
store your personal data. GraphicExpenditure provides methods to input the data and present those data.




How to run it:
Since the application is hosted by dropbox, you need to have a Dropbox account before any coding and testing. After register
and sign in Dropbox, follow below steps to make GraphicExpenditure run:

Create a folder under your Public folder of Dropbox;

Copy all the files of this application to the new folder;

Right click the application's main page (financial app.html) and select "copy public link";

Paste the link to your browser (Chrome preferred) to run GraphicExpenditure.
